VASL v5 will read v4 saved games and logfiles, provided that you have the
VASL4.mdx extention in your Extensions folder. Specify this folder in the
File > User Preferences > Extensions tab. If a v4.0 file won't open correctly
in v5, try opening the game in v4 and re-saving it, then re-open the game in
v5.

The VASL4.mdx file also serves as a repository for 'obsolete' imagefiles that
are replaced in upgraded versions of v5. The most recent version of VASL4.mdx
is 5.7.

Check the Help > About splash screen to see the version numbers.

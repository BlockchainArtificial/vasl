Two buttons (& fkeys) control shading of the map:
	Night (F9)
	LV Hindrance (F11)

Their effects are purely visual, and don't alter the operation of the existing
LOS mechanism. Night effects can obscure the images of the LOS-string & its msg-
flags, but it doesn't change or alter the content of the LOS-string/msgs. One
can toggle Night off while checking LOS, then turn it back on.

Night causes a grey-screen to be drawn over the entire map, including any ctrs.
Certain ctrs/overlays (as defined in Ch. E) will automatically 'erase' the Night
effects from areas of the map, but won't affect the LV Hindrance shading. For
example, a Prep/Def/Gunflash/Flame marker will 'unshade' its hex. An FFE overlay
will 'unshade' all 7 hexes of its blast area. A Blaze ctr will unshade all 19
hexes (2-hex radius) of its 'illumination area'. Starshell and IR ctrs/overlays
behave in a similar fashion. 

The Flame ctr will automatically increase the size of its illumination
when it is ctrl-F Flipped to a Blaze. The Trip Flare ctr will activate its
illumination when it is unHIPped, but won't illuminate while HIP.

The shaded map, LOS engine, and any applied 'unshade' ctrs/overlays, are 'dumb'
to the existing map-terrain. So, an applied illumination-area ctr/overlay will
unshade areas that, by rule, should still be shaded. In this case, players must
manually apply 'shade' overlays to the obscured areas. These overlays will not
respond to the 'unshade' effects of the ctrs, and must be manually replaced
as needed.

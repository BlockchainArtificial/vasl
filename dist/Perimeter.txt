4 counters in the Other > Control tray have a special ability:
	Red Trail
	Yellow Trail
	Green Trail
	Blue Trail
	
Use them to draw Campaign Game Perimeter outlines.

Procedure: Drag the desired Trail counter to a hex-center. Use the Move-cmds
to navigate as needed, defining the desired perimeter. The counter will leave
a large dot in each hex it stops in. Unlike other counters, Trails will not add
existing counters to its stack as it Moves through their hexes. If moved
manually, it will not dot any intervening hexes. It might be better to assemble
a continuous perimeter from two or more ctrs, so selected portions can be
erased & re-drawn individually.

    ctrl-T Trail - toggle the dots display on/off.
    ctrl-H HIP - hide the Trail from your opponent, or dis/enable dotting.
    ctrl-R Reset - erase a ctr's existing Trail and begin a new one.
    ctrl-1 - 1st line of user-text
    crrl-2 - 2nd line of user-text
    ctrl-3 - 3rd line of user-text
    Move - the Trail ctrs will respond to the key-board Move commands.
    
Make a logfile to restore your perimeter after erasure:
1. After drawing the perimeter dots, start a (properly-named) logfile.
2. Using shift-click, select all perimeter ctrs on the map.
3. Delete them w/ ctrl-D.
4. Un-delete them w/ the Undo button, then stop your logfile.
    Now you can restore your Trails by running this logfile on a savegame file.
Thanks to Larry Rohlfing for this nifty technique!

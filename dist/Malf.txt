This function provides a list of ctrs & markers that require attention during
the Rally-Phase. Only ctrs dragged to the map from VASL v5.5 (or later) tray
will be included - ctrs created in previous versions of VASL, or from Extensions,
will not show in the list.

Procedure:
After you load a game, a new icon (representing a Malf Gun) will appear in the
'VASL controls' dlog. Tag the button to open a resizable subdialog, where folders
representing the current map(s) will appear. Double-click a folder to open it, &
a list of those hexes containing broken/malf ctrs will drop down. Double-click
the hex-folders to open them & a list of ctrs will drop down. Click on one of the
listed ctrs, and the main map will attempt to re-center on that hex. All off-map
ctrs will appear in a single folder named 'offboard'. The ctrs in the list are
'live' - right-click on one, or tag it to give it the highlight - give it a ctrl-
command & that change will be immediately duplicated by its on-map twin.

During your Rally-Phase, examine this list while making your rally / repair
rolls. Make changes to the ctrs in the list, flipping or deleting them as
appropriate. If you make your changes on the list, the ctrs will immediately
disappear from the list if they no longer meet its criteria for display. If you
make your changes on the map, tag the list's 'Refresh' button to update it.

Only these counters will appear in the list:
	All Broken MMC & SMC ctrs
	All malfed SW ctrs
	All Malfed Dismantleable Guns (in both their 1/2" & 5/8" states)
	All Malfed Guns (v5.9 and later, only)
	DM & Disrupt markers
	MG & Gun Malf markers (but not their Disabled flips)
	Vehicle MA / SA / MG Malf markers (but not their Disabled flips)
	Shock / UK markers (both sides)
	stun & STUN markers (but not their +1 / Recall flips)

Use blue SW/Gun Malf ctrs to mark your Malfed ctrs if the ctrs themselves
don't appear in the 'Broken Units' dlog.

Your oppo will not see any of your HIPped ctrs in his 5BRK dlog, but will see a
'?-ctr' (say, a malfed SW that was moved out of LOS in the APh and was able to
gain Concealment in the CCPh). Players should adopt the technique of HIPping
any Concealed malfed SW, and adding a generic ?-ctr to the stack.

	Only ctrs created from base VASL v5.5 (or later) will be displayed.
	Only Guns from base VASL v5.9 (or later) will be displayed.
	Ctrs from earlier versions of VASL will not be included.
	Ctrs from Extensions (especially those created prior to v5.5) will probably
	not show.

Caveats:
The maps and their hexes aren't listed in alphanumerical order, but in the order
that VASSAL 'reads' the state of the game. Similarly, the ctrs listed in each hex
probably won't appear in their correct 'stacking' order, but in 'as-read' game-
state order. Consult the actual map-window to determine which brokies are/aren't
under a DM/Disrupt marker.
This extension may not be appropriate for Tournament play - player-pairs &
tournament directors must decide whether to allow its use.


Acknowlegements:
	Stefan Fiedler made the original request for this function.
	rk added an 'Inventory' widget to VASSAL v2.8 that was easily adapted
to this purpose.
	Thanks Stefan and rk!

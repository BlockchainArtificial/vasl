--Checking LOS

    The LOS-checking feature has been deprecated in VASL 5.9.3, pending a
cleanup and rejiggering of the LOS code. You can still hit the F10 key and
draw a LOS line, but VASL will not tell you whether the LOS is blocked or
hindered, nor will it check for LOS info (the .map file) upon loading a board.

   After pressing the LOS button, left click the mouse in any hex (the "source"
hex) and drag the mouse to any other hex (the "target" hex) to draw a LOS line.
If the mouse pointer is not in the center of a hex, the line will be drawn 
to/from the nearest hex spine. The last LOS line drawn remains displayed 
on the screen as long as VASL is in LOS mode.
